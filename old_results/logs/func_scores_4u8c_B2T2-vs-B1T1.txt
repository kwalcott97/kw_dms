Using pseudocount 0.5
Requiring at least 29944.544 total wildtype counts for pre_count, which is the greater of min_wt_count=1000 and min_wt_frac=0.001 of the 29944544 total counts.

Adequate pre_count wildtype counts of 6848397

Requiring at least 26443.404000000002 total wildtype counts for post_count, which is the greater of min_wt_count=1000 and min_wt_frac=0.001 of the 26443404 total counts.
