These samples are for library='LibB'

Getting pre_selection_sample barcode counts from results/barcode_counts/LibB-231017-DMSO_bio1-1_counts.csv

Getting post_selection_sample barcode counts from results/barcode_counts/LibB-231017-C7_bio2-1_counts.csv

Using pseudocount 0.5
Requiring at least 29944.544 total wildtype counts for pre_count, which is the greater of min_wt_count=1000 and min_wt_frac=0.001 of the 29944544 total counts.

Adequate pre_count wildtype counts of 6848397

Requiring at least 29745.99 total wildtype counts for post_count, which is the greater of min_wt_count=1000 and min_wt_frac=0.001 of the 29745990 total counts.

Adequate post_count wildtype counts of 6752821
